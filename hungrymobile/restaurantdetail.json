I must say that I have seen many disc but this was one of the best managed disc with all the look and feel. The cheery on the top was the amazing food..so the end result was- a day well spent..i would recommend this place to all party lovers and people who like to spend quality time with their friends. Moreover, we got 20% discount from hungrydunia which made our evening even memorable",
